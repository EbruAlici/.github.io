    <h2>The difference in '=' vs '==' vs '.equals'</h2>
    <p>If you wanted to assign the value on the right to the value on the left you would use '='.

    <p>You would use the '==' if you wanted to compare two values
    using int, boolean, float or characters. If the value on the left and the right are exactly the same it will return true and if it is not then it would return false.</p>

    <h4>Examples:</h4>

    <ul>
    <li>1 == 1 //True </li>
    <li>1 == 2 //False</li>
    <li>"x" == "x" //True</li>
    <li>"x" == "y" //False</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The purpose of 'import java.util.Scanner' is:</h2>


    <p>The use of import allows you to use that functionality defined some where else in that class you are currently in.</p>

    <h4>Example:<h/4>
      <ul>
      <li>import java.util.Scanner;</li>
      <li>public class Example { </li>
      <li>public class static void main(String[] args){</li>
      <li>Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);</li>
      <li>System.out.println("What is your name?")</li>
      <li>input.next();//program pauses and waits for an answer.</li>
      <li>}</li>
      <li>}</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Math Object</h2>

      <p>Math is a class built into java that contains several math related static members and methods. Which means you can use them without justifying the class. Names of classes are capitalized in java, so it's typed in as Math and not math.</p>

      <p>Math.random() returns a random double value between 0 and 1 including 0 but never 1.</p>

      <h2>Cast double to an int<h2>

      <p>A 'Double' holds a value that usually contains a number with a decimal point such as 1.99, 2.99. There are times when you want an integer value. You can change a 'double' to an 'integer' by putting an (int) in front of it.</p>

      <h4>Example:</h4>
      <ul>
      <li>(Int) 11.22 // 11 </li>
      <li> (Int) 12.11 // 12 </li>
      </ul>

      <p>The number after the decimal is dropped and the number before the decimal gets returned</p>

      <h4>Example:</h>
      <ul>
      <li>(Int)(Math.random() * 11) //gives you a range between 0 and 10</li>
      <li>((Int)(Math.random() * 20) + 1) // gives you range between 1 and 20</li>
      </ul>


      <h2>New Experiences</h2>

      <p>I am really excited to learn java and also a little scared.  I have been doing bookkeeping type of jobs for the past 25 years and I am bored with it and I am ready for something fun.  I have in the past three years or so have been doing some html and CSS and I really enjoyed it. Recently I have been kind of doing some beginners java script on Free Code Camp and it was challenging at times, but I still enjoyed it.  My brother recently attended Skill Distillery and he had a lot of positive things to say about it, so I decided to apply.  I think it will help me learn better if I can be in a class room where I can see examples and when I am struggling on a code, I will have someone there that can help me understand how to figure out what I am doing wrong. I am a little scared because I have low self-esteem and sometimes, I feel like just giving up a lot. I really do hope that I will be able to succeed in this class.</p>
